# InstaQuack
For this project, I implemented a system similar to that of social media platforms. This implementation is based on the publisher/subscriber model whereby publisher threads and subscriber threads share access to the same data; this data was stored in a FIFO queue such that the first entry to be popped from the queue was always the entry located at the front of the queue, and new entries were to be added to the back of the queue. The publisher threads added to this queue of shared data as long as it was not full, while subscriber threads pulled from the queue as long as it was not empty. 

One important thing to note is that with this shared data, it must be ensured that publisher and subscriber threads are not accessing the data in parallel. To prevent corruption of the data, we used a mutex lock. A thread must obtain this lock before accessing the data. As long as a thread has obtained the lock, no other thread may operate on the shared data. Once the thread is finished operating on the shared data, it may release the lock, enabling another thread access it. This process continues until each of the threads have successfully terminated.
